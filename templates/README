This package makes up the generated MCV framework.

It is made up of a Controller, a Table, and a Row.

The dispatcher (which is part of the web-dispatcher package) dispatches
requests over to the generated controller.

The generated controller is actually quite bare-bones, as it inherits most of its
functionality (CURD operations) from the Base Controller.

The Controller's job is to interact with the various other objects (mostly tables,
rows and templates - aka views) to make sure that the request is fulfilled sucessfuly.

The Table provides an interface to the data that represents a database table,
for example which columns are primary keys, which tables refer to this table,
and which foreign keys this table has.

The generated table provides the data itself, and inherits the interface from the
Base Table.

Likewise, the Row provides an interface to the rows within a given table,
allowing access to the data stored within an actual row.

Plugging in to Apache:

The build/install process should create a configuration file which plugs directly
into apache. The configuration file should look something like this:

    #####
    <Location /[% APP_NAME %]>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::Request::Dispatcher
        SetEnv DispatcherConf /data/[% APP_NAME %]/[% APP_NAME %].cfg
    </Location>
    PerlRequire conf.d/[% APP_NAME %].pl
    #####

The [% APP_NAME %].pl script should 'use' all generated Controllers/Tables/Rows as well
as the dispatcher. This is because the dispatcher does not load modules of its
own accord because that would be a security risk (URI's map to module names)

The installation process should also install an application-specific configuration
file.

The name of which is defined by the environment variable "DispatcherConf".
This configuration file defines things such as which database is used
for this app, where the templates are stored, and what the default
controller is called. An example is here:

    #####
    db_dsn="DBI:Pg:database=[% DATABASE_NAME %];host=[% DATABASE_HOST %]"
    db_username=myUserName
    db_password=myPassword

    templatePath="/data/[% APP_NAME %]/templates"

    defaultController=[% TABLES.0.moduleName %]
